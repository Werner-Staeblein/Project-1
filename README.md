# Color Scheme

![Color Palette](readme_images/Color_Palette.png)


Color palette used with meaning and interpreation of blue color in mind. Blue conveys a sense of trust, stability and reliability. 

Color blue as core for the color scheme also conveys dependability, an important factor for the underlying product advertised ('dependable real estate developer')

# Typograhpy

Font type that conveys stability and credibility (Open Sans) used.
Google font-type hosted locally (without CDN) for reasons of European GDPR. Minimal loss on performance through local hosting of googlefonts but GDPR rules weigh more than performance benefit of CDN

# Images

Obtaining consistent AND FREE images usable for project on sites such as Pexels, Unsplash, Pixaby was difficult.

Images generated with image-generators.

Image Generator used:

[DeepAI](https://deepai.org/)

Selected images (unsplash, pexels) that are free of licenses in addition to images generated by image-generators.

# Accessibility

- use of aria labels with descriptive alt text for images and tags to procide information for screenreaders
- use of ARIA roles and aria-label to ensure smooth experience with screenreaders
- Website was checked with Google Lighthouse for color balance to be sufficient and to have best possible access for users with color blindness

# Visual effects

Some subtle highlighting of background-color on hover/focus state for buttons

## Buttons
Uniform styling of all buttons across all the different pages sith subtle uniform hover/focus-state effect

# Testing

Testing was ongoing with DevTools of Google. Testing done across other Browsers (Firefox, Edge)

The following issues were addressed while testing:

* remove redundant .css files in fontawesome folder so that only the fontawesome .css in the folder that are used in the project (reduces render-blocking files and increases site-load speed)

* ARIA warnings in lighthouse addressed with aria-labels and use of role. 

* ARIA warning on contrast. Occassionally, the lighthouse testing showed an insufficient contrast (scores reported yb lighthouse not always consistent with various test cycles). Change of colors and background colors to ensure sufficient contrast

* Performance and load of website was insufficient initally. Reduced image sizes to ensure that performance is improved

*  Lighthouse testing indicates minimal performance losses (values of 98-99) on mobile for use of fontawesome and google fonts locally (instaed of CDN). In order to be compliant 
with GDPR (a European law always matters more than a lighthouse performance score), I decided to maintain fontawesome and googlefonts locally without CDN as performance loss
is still acceptable. No performance losses on desktop

1. **[W3 Markup Validation](https://validator.w3.org/) - HTML Validation**

All sites of the website was tested with HTML validator while developing. No errors or warnings were found on any of the pages

2. **[W3 Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) - CSS Validation**

The CSS stylesheet was tested with CSS validator (jigsaw) while developing. No errors were found.

![style.css CSS validator check](readme_images/jigsaw_CSS_validator_check.png)

3. **[Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse)**

Lighthouse reported some minor performance losses for use of fontawesome and googlefonts locally. Both stored locally instead of CDN for reasons of GDPR. Minor losses on performance acceptable rather than using GDPR non-compliant CDN
